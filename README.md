Aim: Write and implement Python code that integrates with multiple AI tools to automate the task of interacting with APIs, comparing outputs, and generating actionable insights with Multiple AI Tools

# AI Tools Required:

1.  **OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/GPT-4):** Used for **content generation** (e.g., drafting a social media post).

2.  **Hugging Face Inference API (Pre-trained Sentiment Analysis Model):** Used for **sentiment analysis** of the generated content.

# Explanation:
Experiment the persona pattern as a programmer for any specific applications related with your interesting area. 
Generate the outoput using more than one AI tool and based on the code generation analyse and discussing that. 

In this experiment, the objective is to design Python code that can communicate with multiple AI tools, fetch responses for a given query, and compare their outputs to analyze variations in style, accuracy, and detail.
1.	Integration with APIs:
Python provides libraries like requests, openai, and transformers which can connect with different AI platforms.
2.	Query Execution:
A single prompt is given to multiple AI tools (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Hugging Face models). Each tool generates its own output based on the same input.
3.	Comparison & Analysis:
The outputs are collected, displayed, and compared in terms of fluency, correctness, and relevance. This helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each AI model.
4.	Applications:
o	Text summarization
o	Chatbot development
o	Code generation
o	Sentiment analysis
o	Domain-specific automation (e.g., Flood Risk Management, IoT, Robotics)
This experiment also highlights the persona pattern of a programmer, where the developer takes the role of an orchestrator—sending queries to multiple AI systems, evaluating responses, and selecting the most effective solution for real-world applications.

# Output:

# Conclusion:
The experiment successfully achieved its aim by writing and implementing a robust Python script that integrates the **OpenAI API** for content generation and the **Hugging Face Inference API** for sentiment analysis. By using the output of the sentiment model as the decision-making metric against a predefined threshold, the code effectively automates the task of **comparing AI outputs and generating actionable insights**—specifically, flagging content that does not meet the required positive brand sentiment and subsequently using the first AI tool to provide a revision suggestion. This demonstrates the high **compatibility, efficiency, and architectural necessity** of using Python as the central development platform for complex, multi-tool AI applications, moving beyond single-API interaction to create sophisticated, intelligent workflows.

# Result: 
The corresponding Prompt is executed successfully.
